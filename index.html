											<p class="ex2">Lentor Ambulance Dispatch Service (Capstone)
												
												<p class="ex"> Jan 2022 - Present </p>
												
												We partnered with Lentor to digitise their ambulance scheduling system. Our target audience is focused on patients who commute to and from their houses and healthcare centres regularly. We are in the midst of collaborating with all the stakeholders to develop a web interface that will convert all of their manual operations into an automated tool. As a group of 6, we have split into trios in charge of developing a routing algorithm using data structures and algorithms for the automatic route mapping and allocation of ambulances. While, the rest will facilitate the construction of a web app consisting of schedules and routes for all the different stakeholders involved.

											<p class="ex"> May 2020 -  Present    </p>
												
											Developed an interactive, augmented reality system for medical device designers to learn anatomy and physiology in a user-friendly and immersive learning environment. The app indicates the parts of a musculoskeletal system upon hovering a smartphone over an area. It was designed using Unity and C# while other functions were created using Kinect.

											<p class="ex2">Predicting MBTI Personality Types Using Deep Learning and Machine Learning
												
												<p class="ex"> Sept -  Dec  </p>
												Using data science concepts, my group and I programmed models to predict peoples' Myers-Briggs personality type. With a Twitter dataset of over 8000 labelled tweets, my group and I deployed various machine learning methods and specifically altered deep learning techniques to identify the best model to carry out the purpose. We also hosted presentations and co-wrote reports to teaching faculty regarding our findings and project progression.

											<p class="ex2"> Internship at Advanced Digital Sciences Centre
												

												<p class="ex"> May -  Sept   </p>
												
												I partnered with ADSC in developing an artificial intelligence-based detection and assessment model for time delay attacks in industrial cyber-physical systems. The robust model was then rendered into a Django web interface for laypeople usage. Throughout the internship, I was responsible for delivering bi-weekly updates to my teams and received consistent praise and feedback to further elevate the product's efficiency.

											<p class="ex2"> Unabiz Indoor Positioning System (Elements of Software Construction Core Module Project)
												

												<p class="ex"> Jan -  Apr    </p>
												
												A real-time location tracking system mobile application was created in partnership with Unabiz. The project required my team to pinpoint the mobile phone/user's location within the school campus. We deployed the help of wifi MAC addresses and ran it through a custom-made complex neural network structure for the app to be self-reliant in displaying the user's location.

											<p class="ex2"> Calorize (Information System Core Module Project)

												<p class="ex">Sept -  Dec </p>
												
												My team and  I developed an android application that focused on the well-being of SUTD students by monitoring their daily meal intake. To make the application useful and practical, we implemented a range of functions that took a multi-pronged approach to promote a healthy lifestyle for the students. Firstly, it has nutrition information of all dishes sold in the university's stalls, allowing students to record the dishes and their nutrition intake. On top of that, a custom variety of exercise sets with detailed information will be recommended to each user to burn off calories accordingly. Last but not least, we also have a reward system where users can unlock different profile pictures or earn a medal for meeting specific requirements.

											<p class="ex2"> Earth's Hero (The Digital World Core Module Project)
												

												<p class="ex"> Apr -  May    </p>
												
												I created a text-based game that focused on educating players of all ages on the importance of being environmentally friendly. Its structure was implemented upon a combination of Python OOP concepts and I received praise from instructors for coming up with a thought-provoking project.

												<p class="ex">Sept -  Dec </p>
												
												
												
												My group and I built a pair of physiotherapy shoes to respond to the growing demands arising from the ageing society. The shoes were constructed using a variety of Physics and Social Science ideas. Our group of five set out to make footwear where the elderly could practise walking in to improve/maintain mobility. On top of the scientific component, we added a layer of interactivity using LED light strips to guide users through the foot exercises while making the activity more entertaining. The project was then showcased at an exhibition, where we successfully presented our product.
